    description: 'Hi, my name is Thao Nguyen. I have a background in food technology and public health nutrition. I decided to start my journey in the twists and turns of computer programming, began self-learning code and then I wanted to undertake a more in-depth and serious training. In 2020, Interface3 gave me the opportunity to enter into the fascinating world of web programming via their excellent full-time professional training ‘Web Application Developer (Full-Stack)’. My favourite languages are C# (ASP.NET), Javascript (React) and PHP (Symfony).<br /><br />I totally understand that being a junior web developer, I will have tons of things to learn and improve myself in the first few years. Development is a lengthy process with substantial effort and a lot of patience. I believe that with my knowledge and competences, and with my high motivation, I can step by step conquer this new exciting journey.<br /><br />I am currently completing my studies and I’m looking for an internship starting on 24 May 2021 for a period of 6 to 8 weeks. I am ready to take on new challenges to put my new skills into practice.',

It is a mazing, when at the end of the day, I can create something that didn’t exist that morning. It is a massive feeling of accomplishment and itself satisfying.',

        content: 'I love to code because it allows me to be creative every day. The programmer, like the poet – “he builds his castles in the air”, unlike the poet’s words, the programmer can produce visible output, create something that people interact with, use, touch and work with. Moreover, coding will give me the chance to make my own decisions: I can name variables, classes, methods and I also decide the algorithm, the logic, and finally the layout. That really feels like being a wizard.',

        content: 'I’ve learned so much by overcoming the challenges that come with coding. I’ve learnt how to collect information from Google, StackOverFlow, forums… and then put these pieces together to figure it out. I’ve been inspired by reading the code of others which gives me an idea of how they think and how they solve problems. And everytime when I learn a new programming language, apply a new framework, or try to solve a problem with a new algorithm, I let myself make mistakes and experience those failures and from that I can grow and improve myself. Not only does coding make me a better problem solver but it also teaches me patience and to never stop learning.',
