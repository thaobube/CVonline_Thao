It is a really interesting simulation aquarium program. The aquarium contains fish and seaweed. Each fish has a name, an age and a sex. There is a method to add fish or seaweed into the quarium.<br /><br />There are 2 types of fish (with 6 breeds in total): Type 1: Carnivorous fish: Grouper, Tuna, Clownfish which will eat seaweeds; Type 2: Herbivorous fish: Sole, Bass, Carp which will eat another fishes (can neither eat himself, nor eat a fish of his kind). All fishes and seaweeds have their health points (10 HP at the beginning and die at 0 HP).<br /><br />With each passing turn, the fish gets more and more hungry: it loses 1 HP and each seaweed gains 1 HP. A fish that is sufficiently hungry (5 HP or less) seeks to eat randomly. Herbivores will gain 3 HP after eating, and Carnivores will gain 5 HP after eating, each fish is bitten will be lost 4 HP. All fishes and seaweeds are born at 0 and die at 20 turns. A fish that is not hungry will find another fish randomly with same breed and opposite sex to reproduce. The seaweed has 10 HP will separate in two seaweeds with half the HP(the child seaweed\'age is 0 but the parent seaweed retains its age).<br /><br /><em>Coming soon!</em>',
